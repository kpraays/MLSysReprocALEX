## 513-project
This repo is for project submitted as part of course COMP 513 at McGill University, Fall 2023.

To keep track of scripts, plots and reports for the Advanced computer systems project.

#### Repo structure:
Following is the manner in which repo is organised.
- ALEX: contains the cloned repo for ALEX from Microsoft.
- artifacts: plots, figures, supporting docs and external link go to this directory.
- report: it contains the link to our overleaf report. once complete, we will add the pdf of report and supporting figures to this directory.
- run: it contains the code we wrote to run ALEX on our systems and generate plots/ results.
    - (move run to ALEX if there is issue in calling scripts)
  
- Feel free to change the repo structure however you see fit.

#### Note on workflow:
(please correct me if there is something wrong)
- We read the paper. Make our notes.
- Run ALEX in different environments: mimi and locally
- Pick 3 plots to be created. These plots have to be generated for baseline and for ALEX on different testing environments.
- Write explanation for why we are getting the plots we are getting.

- make notes, write stuff in google doc: once we complete every thing, we will put it in separate files under artifacts so that it is properly organized.

#### Where to access files for creating reports and sharing information?
- Report will be created on overleaf: **link to edit** [https://www.overleaf.com/8618816293qmppjpyyvgsm#353b0b](https://www.overleaf.com/8618816293qmppjpyyvgsm#353b0b)

- Google doc to share information amongst each other: [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJQppZ9PtSxbBmIPvyNXJNvlhyqjbDh9T2Zvztn0WM0/edit?usp=sharing)

- Put the files/ pdfs/ external things which you find interesting in artifacts folder.

- Final plots to be used in the report will go in overleaf. Rest of them can be kept in artifacts with their own directory.
